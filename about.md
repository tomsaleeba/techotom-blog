I've been working as a professional software developer since the start of 2009. The majority of my experience and my interest is in enterprise Java and client side web technologies (CSS, JavaScript/jQuery, HTML, etc).

I'm a stronger believer in (and user of) open source software and enjoy regularly developing applications and writing code outside of work. I also have a passion for networking and infrastructure so I frequently play with client-server technologies and experiment with virtualisation.

I've found that I really enjoy mentoring and teaching so this blog is a way for me to share the knowledge I have with the online community.
