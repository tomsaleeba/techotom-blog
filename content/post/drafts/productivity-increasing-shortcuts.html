<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>A lot of software contain keyboard shortcuts (accelerators) to allow power users to work faster. I was already a fan of keyboard shortcuts because I'd seen the power they have but <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596519544.do">The Productive Programmer by Neal Ford</a> introduced me to some new ones and makes a really good argument why you should use them. As a software developer, just like Neal suggests, I feel it's part of my job role to be the most effective user of a computer that I can be and using the keyboard allows me to achieve this.</p>
<p>Most software will tell you what it's shortcuts are either by putting the shortcut sequence in the menu that you would access with the mouse or through it's documentation. However, here's a list of shortcuts that I found for various software that I regularly use and make my life much easier, I hope they'll help you too.</p>
<h1>Windows XP (and onwards)</h1>
<p>Note that Win is the Windows key that usually sits between Ctrl and Alt on the left of your keyboard or Alt and the context menu on the right of your keyboard.<strong></strong></p>
<h2><strong>F2</strong> | rename</h2>
<p>You can use this shortcut in explorer (Windows explorer that is) to rename whatever is selected. Beware that if you have multiple files selected and use this shortcut, it will rename the first file to the name you chose (ie. <strong>newName</strong>) and then name the others the same name but with an increasing suffix ie. <strong>newName (1)</strong>, <strong>newName (2)</strong>, etc.</p>
<h2><strong>F4</strong> or Alt + d | focus address</h2>
<p>When in explorer, using the mouse to select/click files is way to slow if you already know what you're looking for because you'll waste most of your time looking for the file in the list. To fix this, press <strong>F4</strong> or <strong>Alt + d</strong> to focus the address bar and from here you can type the path to the directory you want to go. You can speed this up even more by using the <strong>Tab</strong> key to cycle through auto-complete suggestions. You still need to type the separating <strong>\</strong> between each directory level.</p>
<h2><strong>Win + r</strong> | run</h2>
<p>This is great for launching programs that are already on the system's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PATH_%28variable%29"><strong>PATH</strong></a> because you don't have to fully qualify their directory or even their extension in most cases. So for things like Microsoft Paint (<strong>mspaint.exe)</strong> or the caluclator (<strong>calc.exe</strong>) you can simply using the <strong>win + r</strong> shortcut, type <strong>calc</strong> and hit <strong>enter</strong>. This dialogue also has a history so most times you can get away with only typing the first part of the name. Another use is when someone emails you a path to a directory on a shared drive, you can copy the path and use <strong>win + r</strong>, paste the path in and hit <strong>enter</strong>. Note that if you like this kind of functionality, you can get a third party application (like <a href="http://www.launchy.net/">Launchy</a>) that is capable of indexing much more and doing pattern matching so you have to type less.</p>
<p><strong>Win + u</strong> for utilities<br />
<strong>Win + d</strong> to show desktop<br />
<strong>Win + m</strong> to minimise all windows<br />
<strong>Backspace</strong> to go back in explorer<br />
<strong>Ctrl + Shift + Esc</strong> to launch the task manager<br />
<strong>F8</strong> to go to boot menu when Windows is starting up. If you're unsure<br />
Alt + F4 close</p>
<h1>Firefox</h1>
<h2>Backspace or Alt + &lt;left arrow&gt; | back</h2>
