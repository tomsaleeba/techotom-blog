<p>running tomcat (actually vfabric tc) in eclipse (actually STS) and using a web deployment descriptor thingo.</p>
<p>it worked when you built using maven and deployed manually and when you looked in the debugger you'd see the right class source but the object itself wouldn't have the property/method.</p>
<p>problem caused by updating a dependency JAR version and updating it in the referencing POM but the deployment descriptor is never updated because the POM is missing:</p>
<p>....</p>
<p>				maven-eclipse-plugin<br />
				2.9</p>
<p>						org.springframework.ide.eclipse.core.springnature</p>
<p>						org.springframework.ide.eclipse.core.springbuilder</p>
<p>					true<br />
					true<br />
this stuff fixed it \/ \/<br />
					true<br />
					true<br />
					2.0</p>
<p>						5.0</p>
<p>this stuff fixed it /\ /\</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>That way when you run mvn eclipse:eclipse (and refresh the project in eclipse) the deployment descriptor will be updated to reflect the POM.</p>
