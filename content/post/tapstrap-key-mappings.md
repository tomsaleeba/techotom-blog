The [TapStrap](https://www.tapwithus.com/) is an interesting keyboard. It's also
not that cheap so it's understandable if you're apprehensive about buying it.

I wanted to try the layout without buying the keyboard to see how it works for
me. The first step is to find out what the layout is and my Google-fu let me
down because I couldn't find anything written. All the references tell you to
use the TapGenius app.

So here I've transcribed the layout from TapGenius as a reference.
