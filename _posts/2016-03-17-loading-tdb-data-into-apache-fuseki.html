<h1>Background</h1>
<p>I'm working with Apache Jena and Apache Fuseki (v2.3.1) at the moment and today I had the need to load more than one lot of data into Fuseki on start up. I thought I needed an assembler file, and I probably could've used one, but I've ended up using config file for Fuseki.</p>
<p>I was Googling for 'example Fuseki config files' to get up and running quickly but didn't find anything so it's my hope that others can use this blog post to get a TDB data directory loaded into Fuseki using a config file quickly.</p>
<p>All the information was found here: <a href="https://jena.apache.org/documentation/serving_data/#fuseki-configuration-file" target="_blank">https://jena.apache.org/documentation/serving_data/#fuseki-configuration-file</a> but there's not just one whole example that you can copy-paste to get going. You need to read it all and pull the relevant pieces out. RTFM is a good thing, I know, but sometimes we just want to get something running to keep that feedback loop short.</p>
<h1>The config file (assembler.ttl)</h1>
<p>The first thing you want to change is the value of the <span style="font-family:monospace;">tdb:location</span> property in the <span style="font-family:monospace;">&lt;#dataset&gt;</span> entity at the bottom. This should be the path to the TDB data directory on your file system.</p>

[] rdf:type fuseki:Server ;
 # Server-wide context parameters can be given here.
 # For example, to set query timeouts: on a server-wide basis:
 # Format 1: "1000" -- 1 second timeout
 # Format 2: "10000,60000" -- 10s timeout to first result, then 60s timeout to for rest of query.
 # See java doc for ARQ.queryTimeout
 # ja:context [ ja:cxtName "arq:queryTimeout" ; ja:cxtValue "10000" ] ;

 # Load custom code (rarely needed)
 # ja:loadClass "your.code.Class" ;

 # Services available. Only explicitly listed services are configured.
 # If there is a service description not linked from this list, it is ignored.
 fuseki:services (
   &lt;#service1&gt;
 ) .

# Declaration additional assembler items.
[] ja:loadClass "org.apache.jena.tdb.TDB" .

# TDB

&lt;#service1&gt; rdf:type fuseki:Service ;
 fuseki:name "tdb" ; # http://host:port/tdb
 fuseki:serviceQuery "sparql" ; # SPARQL query service
 fuseki:dataset &lt;#dataset&gt; ;
 .

&lt;#dataset&gt; rdf:type tdb:DatasetTDB ;
 tdb:location <span style="color:#ff0000;">"/home/ubuntu/rdf/tdb-data/"</span> ;
 # Query timeout on this dataset (1s, 1000 milliseconds)
 ja:context [ ja:cxtName "arq:queryTimeout" ; ja:cxtValue "1000" ] ;
 # Make the default graph be the union of all named graphs.
 ## tdb:unionDefaultGraph true ;
 .
</pre>
<p>Once you've updated the path to your data, you can run Fuseki with (assuming you named the config file <span style="font-family:monospace;">assembler.ttl</span>):</p>
<pre>./apache-jena-fuseki-2.3.1/fuseki-server --config=assembler.ttl</pre>
