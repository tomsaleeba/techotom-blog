<p>I came across this problem the other day and thought I'd post up the fix because it's simple to fix but a show stopper if you can't.</p>
<p>I'm running Linux Mint 64-bit Cinnamon and Postgres 9.1 as a refenece in case you can't copy-paste my commands.</p>
<p>Basically, when I copied an already running version of postgres to a new box and it failed to start. When I took a look in the postgres log for when you try to start it, I could see that it was complaining about a missing locale. For me, it was "en_AU.UTF-8".</p>
<p>To generate (install) the new locale, run this command:</p>
<p><code>sudo locale-gen <i>yourLocale</i></code></p>
<p>so for me, it was:</p>
<p><code>sudo locale-gen en_AU.UTF-8</code></p>
<p>Then, we need to tell the system that there are new locales with this command:</p>
<p><code>sudo dpkg-reconfigure locales</code></p>
<p>You're done, try to fire up postgres or whatever it was you were trying and you should be in business.</p>
