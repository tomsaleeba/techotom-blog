<h1>Background</h1>
<p>I came across this problem when I was setting up a new box with Linux Mint 13 Cinnamon (64-bit). This machine lives in a corporate type environment and needs to have a proxy configured to have internet access so I suspect that some incorrect proxy settings could've caused this scenario.</p>
<h1>The symptoms</h1>
<p>Here's the output (with boring bits removed) that I got from running <code>sudo apt-get update</code>:</p>

bzip2: Data integrity error when decompressing.
Input file = (stdin), output file = (stdout)<br />
It is possible that the compressed file(s) have become corrupted.
You can use the -tvv option to test integrity of such files.<br />
You can use the `bzip2recover' program to attempt to recover
data from undamaged sections of corrupted files.<br />

<p>You'll notice the second to last line speaks about a local path, which made me think that the issue is with some data that we've cached locally and it's not being overwritten with fresh stuff.</p>
<h1>The fix</h1>
<p>The fix is to delete (or rename) the cached data that apt keeps so it'll refresh everything. I found there's two locations that needed to be deleted/renamed:<br />
<code>/var/lib/apt</code><br />
<code>/var/cache/apt</code></p>
<p>Then run <code>sudo apt-get update</code> to get fresh copies of all the indexes, etc.</p>
<p>You should be good to go :D</p>
