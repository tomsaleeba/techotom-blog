# Overview

I found this problem when I was trying to bundle a maven project as an OSGi bundle to use with Tycho. The bundle I was trying to make was effectively a shaded/uber JAR that has all the dependencies inlined inside of the final artifact JAR.

# The cause

This problem is caused by a Java class file existing in the default/unamed package. It could come from anywhere in the dependency chain, including your own project, but in this case it came from one of my dependencies; JDOM.

# The fix

A Google for this error message finds lots of mail archive discussions on ways to fix it but none of them allude to the fact that it might be coming from an dependency. It's my hope that this post will link searches for this error message to the fix that is posted here:Â [https://developer.atlassian.com/display/DOCS/Using+JDOM+in+OSGi]()

In case that site ever changes or goes down, here's what they posted:

> For some reason, the author of JDOM decided to break one of the fundamental rules of Java, that is, do not put classes in the root package. JDOM has a class called `JDOMAuthor` in the root package. If you want to include JDOM in your OSGi bundle, you'll need to remove these classes. In Maven, you can do it like this:

A huge thanks to jproper and [Sarah Maddox](https://developer.atlassian.com/display/~smaddox) for posting the fix.
