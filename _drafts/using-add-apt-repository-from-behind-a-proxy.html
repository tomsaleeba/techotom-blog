<p>Set http_proxy and ftp_proxy (not https because it has direct access) in /etc/enviroment.<br />
Set http:proxy and ftp::proxy in /etc/apt/apt.conf (again, not https::proxy)<br />
sudo su to root<br />
run the add-apt-repository command (DON'T RUN AS SUDO)</p>
<p>If you have issues, check that the new variables have taken effect by doing an echo.<br />
If it still doesn't work, restart to be sure that all shells have the new values.</p>
